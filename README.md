# matrix-ping-bot

Very easy and straightforward implementation of a ping-pong bot measuring some performance figures.

How to run:
`npm install`

And in two different sessions:
`npm run ping`
and
`npm run pong`

The bots can be invited to any room and will join.
The matrix room on matrix.camino.foundation used for testing is https://matrix.to/#/!exLbbCZOEfLyKxQLFT:matrix.camino.network?via=matrix.camino.network
